<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## **About The Project**
This web application accepts a CSV file of employees and parses that list to output a list of employees that have a birthday this month. The generated list can be exported into a new CSV file.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## **Getting Started**
Follow these steps to run the application locally.

### Prerequisites
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v16.x)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v7.x)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jackthta/birthday-month.git
   ```
2. Change into project directory
   ```sh
   cd birthday-month
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   pnpm i
   ```
4. Launch the application
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```

<br />

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## **Usage**

### Format
The CSV file of employees needs to be a specific format:
```
name,birthday
...
```
- The birthday needs to be wrapped with double quotes and can be in any format that is accepted by the `Date` constructor.

Example:

```
name,birthday
Dennis Ritchie,"January 01, 1970"
Ken Thompson,"January 01, 1970"
...
```
- For clarity, the CSV header `name,birthday` is required as the first row of the file. The subsequent rows can be filled as necessary; they just have to follow the header format (Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson entries are examples).

### CSV File Generator
If you'd like, you can conveniently use this [online generator](https://generatedata.com/generator) to generate a CSV file of imaginary employees. Please be sure to have the format as `CSV` and the first two row inputs as a `Names` and `Date` data type, respectively.

<br />

<!-- TESTS -->
## **Tests**
The testing tool used in this project is Playwright. The documentation can be found [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests).

### Requirements
**There are two required files that need to exist in the `employee_data` directory before you run the test suite.** These files are used in the test suite to test against (test-generated) files or the UI.
1. `employee_data.csv`
   - The original CSV file of employees.
2. `employee_${THIS_MONTH}_birthdays.csv`
   - The CSV file that you exported from the application (contains list of employees that have a birthday this month).

### Start test
To run the test suite located in the `tests` directory, run this command:
```
pnpm test
```
